# calcWords
A wonderfully useless program.

Another program written with Pydroid 3 on Android. Absolutely useless, but amusing.
This converts words and numbers to calculator-style characters (seven-segment displays). Of course, not all letters are able to be displayed in this manner (k, m, v, w, x, z). 
These will be printed normally.
Type 'quit!' to quit.
